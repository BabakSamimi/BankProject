# BankProject
My final high school project -- WIP

This project does **not** focus on design/UI.
It has some bugs that are easily fixable, however, I had to meet a deadline.

Update: February 19th 2019
I just noticed how bad this codebase is, no respect to cohesion at all or where I declare my methods at wrong places.
pls do not use this as a metric for my programming skills
